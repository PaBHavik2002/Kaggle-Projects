This is just an instruction manual.

1. This repo has two files and each file has its own readme file for the key insights
2. These two are the kaggle projects and I am at the starting phase. I would upload more projects in upcoming days to come.

# I hope, people visiting this repo, would understand the level of learning I am at and suggest me the changes or ideas to improve it.
